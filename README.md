# Pok√©dex CLI (Go)

A simple **Pok√©dex-like REPL** built in **Go** that fetches data from the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) and caches results for faster repeated access.  
This project was built as part of the [Boot.dev Build a Pokedex CLI](https://www.boot.dev/courses/build-pokedex-cli-golang) guided course.

---

## üöÄ Features

- **Interactive REPL**: Type commands to explore Pok√©mon data right in your terminal.
- **Pok√©dex Management**: Catch, inspect, and view Pok√©mon you‚Äôve collected.
- **HTTP Networking**: Learn how to make API calls in Go.
- **Caching Layer**: Reduce redundant API requests with an in-memory cache.
- **JSON Parsing**: Deserialize API responses into Go structs.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Commands

Here are some of the commands available inside the REPL:

| Command             | Description                                                               |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `map`               | Lists available Pok√©mon location areas.                                   |
| `explore <area>`    | Shows Pok√©mon encounters in a given area.                                 |
| `catch <pokemon>`   | Attempts to catch the given Pok√©mon (with some chance of failure).        |
| `inspect <pokemon>` | Displays detailed information about a caught Pok√©mon (stats, types, etc). |
| `pokedex`           | Lists all Pok√©mon you have successfully caught.                           |
| `help`              | Shows all available commands.                                             |
| `exit`              | Quits the program.                                                        |

## üìö Chapters Learned

This project covers three main areas:

1. **REPL**  
   Build a basic Read-Eval-Print Loop from scratch in Go.

2. **Cache**  
   Implement an in-memory caching system to optimize repeated API calls.

3. **Pok√©dex**  
   Combine the REPL and caching system into a fully functional Pok√©dex CLI.
